                        <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to bear marketable websites and
                            online services to post
                            a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to bear any
                            person or company in
                            the United States (and possibly the world) that operates websites collecting
                            tête-à-tête
                            Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy
                            policy on its
                            website stating exactly the information being collected and those
                            individualities or companies with
                            whom it’s being participated. – See more at

                        <p>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home runner

                            the first significant runner after entering our website.</p>
                        <p>Our privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can fluently be set up on
